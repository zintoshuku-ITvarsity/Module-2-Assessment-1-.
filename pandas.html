                        <p><strong>WHERE WILL WE FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                        <p>Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wetâ€”just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season</p>
